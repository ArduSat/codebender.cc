	<h1>enter the cloud. enter codebender.</h1>
	<p>Time to revolutionize the way you develop and hack on your projects. {{site_name}} is a platform that helps your next idea come to life. Wether you are a maker, a hardware hacker or an artist, {{ site_name }} allows you to code on the web, faster and easier, using our awesome web editor. Host your Arduino sketches on the cloud and use our next-gen compiler to build and debug your sketches from your browser. When you are done, upload them to your Arduino, straight from your browser. No installations required. <!--Give it a try, join the cloud today. --><strong>Coming soon. Stay tuned!</strong></p>

		<h2>Upload</h2>
		<p>Uploading (aka flashing) your program on the Arduino has never been easier. When you are done coding, you can program your Arduino straight from your browser.<a href="javascript:void()" rel="tooltip" data-original-title="If you are using the Arduino Duemilanove, you'll need the FTDI drivers. If you are using the Arduino Uno, you're already set to go in Mac OS X and Linux, and you will only need to install drivers for Windows">No installations required*</a>. But it gets better. With {{site_name}}, you will soon be able to program your Arduino &amp; Ethernet remotely, from anywhere in the world, straight from {{site_name}}.</p>

		<h2>Open Source</h2>
		<p>We absolutely love open source and we deeply believe in the FOSS philosophy. We think it's the way to go for not only software, but hardware, and other aspects of our lives as well. That's why {{site_name}} is completely open source.</p>
		<p>We have even divided {{site_name}} in smaller pieces, so that you can use only the ones you want. You can use the site's software, the web compiler, the Arduino TFTP bootloader, as well as the Arduino programming Java Applet independently if you want. Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/codebendercc" target="_new">GitHub page.</a></p>
