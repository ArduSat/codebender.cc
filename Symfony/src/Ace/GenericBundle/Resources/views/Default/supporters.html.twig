		<h3>Wyolum</h2>
		<p>WyoLum is a partnership of Open Source enthusiasts collaborating on cool products.</p>
		<p>We want to take DoItYourself to the next level of efficiency by creating a collaboration platform where guerrilla engineering-and-design teams can emerge for the duration of a project, solve a problem, disband and move on to the next project with the main goal of having fun in learning and developing as many cool and interesting projects as we can.</p>

		<h3>Agile Hardware</h2>
		<p>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet.</p>
		<p>We have even divided {{site_name}} in smaller pieces, so that you can use only the ones you want. You can use the site's software, the web compiler, the Ariadne bootloader, as well as the Arduino programming Java Applet independently if you want. Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/codebendercc" target="_new">GitHub page.</a></p>
