<h1>{{ site_name }} libraries<small> what about them?</small></h1>
<div class="marketing">
	<p>{{ site_name }}'s mission is to simplify development for embedded devices, and make them easy to use by hackers, artists, and makers in general. This vision starts by making Arduino programming easier than you could ever imagine. This includes the handling of libraries, one of the biggest pains for Arduino enthusiasts.
	<p>We are working really hard on building an excellent, intuitive and easy to use system to manage libraries automatically. We are proud of what we are building, but we are also aiming for perfection, which means we constantly go back to the drawing board.</p>
	<p>However, that means that we are probably far from completion, and we understand your need to use commonly-found and well-known libraries in your projects. That's why we are adding a list of the most popular external libraries. We are adding these manually, and they are only meant as a temporary solution to a much bigger and more complex problem. It takes a lot of time and effort to manually add a library in our system. Time that would be much better spent in improving {{site_name}} and adding that much-needed feature you asked for. Therefore, we appreciate your patience and hope you understand why this list might be out of date, incomplete, or plain wrong. Our server monkeys are working hard on adding more.</p>

	    <h3>Adafruit RGB LCD</h3>
	    <p>From the library's description:</p>
		<p>This is a library for the Adafruit RGB 16x2 LCD Shield</p>
		<p>Pick one up at the Adafruit shop! ---------> http://http://www.adafruit.com/products/714</p>
		<p>This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the range of LCDs we stock in the shop, such as our classic blue &amp; white as well as the fancy RGB negative and RGB positive. Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then perhaps another 3 to control the RGB backlight for a total of 9 pins. That's half of the pins available on a classic Arduino!</p>
			<p>With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a shield that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the Arduino! The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.</p>

	    <h3>PID</h3>
	    <p>From Wikipedia: "A PID controller calculates an 'error' value as the difference between a measured [Input] and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting [an Output]."</p>
		<p>So, you tell the PID what to measure (the "Input",) Where you want that measurement to be (the "Setpoint",) and the variable to adjust that can make that happen (the "Output".) The PID then adjusts the output trying to make the input equal the setpoint.</p>
		<p>For reference, in a car, the Input, Setpoint, and Output would be the speed, desired speed, and gas pedal angle respectively.</p>

	    <p>This is an Arduino library for communicating with XBees in API mode, with support for both Series 1 (802.15.4) and Series 2 (ZB Pro/ZNet). This library Includes support for the majority of packet types, including: TX/RX, AT Command, Remote AT, I/O Samples and Modem Status.</p>
		<p>Note: This software requires API mode, by setting AP=2. If you are using Series 2 XBee, you'll need to install API Firmware (they ship with AT firmware), then set AP=2. This software will not work correctly with AP=1 Refer to XBeeConfiguration and WhyApiMode for more info.</p>

		<p>Like we said, the above list is by no means complete. It consists of libraries we use often and libraries that someone requested. If you would like us to include a <strong>commonly-used</strong> library, please send us an email at girder at codebender dot cc with the subject "Please include the following library", and we will do our best to include it as soon as possible if we find that it has value for other users as well (or if you persuade us, say, by supporting our <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/codebender">Indiegogo campaign</a>). Thank you for your understanding. We hope you appreciate our hard work.</p>
